# TreeMaxD
Testing against tree-ordered alternative in one-way ANOVA
Testing of H_0:mu_0 = mu_1 = ... = mu_k vs. H_1:mu_0 <= mu_i (at least one strict inequality), for all I >= 1, where mu_i represents the population means of the i-th treatment. The input consists of two variables: sample_data and significance_level. The output consists of the critical value, the Max-D test statistic value, and the result, which indicates whether to reject or not reject the null hypothesis.
